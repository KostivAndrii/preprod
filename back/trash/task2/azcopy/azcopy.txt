/Source:<source>              Specifies the source data from which to copy. 
                              The source can be a directory including: 
                              a file system directory, a blob container, 
                              a blob virtual directory, a storage file share, 
                              or a storage file directory.
                              The source can also be a single file including:
                              a file system file, a blob or a storage file.
                              The source is interpreted according to following rules:
                              1) When either file pattern option /Pattern or
                              recursive mode option /S is specified,
                              the source will be interpreted to a directory.
                              2) When both file pattern option /Pattern and
                              recursive mode option /S are not specified,
                              the source can be a single file or a directory.
                              In this case, AzCopy will choose an existing
                              location as the source, if the source is both
                              an existing file and an existing directory,
                              the source will be interpreted to a single file.
                              
                              
/Dest:<destination>           Specifies the destination to copy to. 
                              The destination can be a directory including:
                              a file system directory, a blob container, 
                              a blob virtual directory, a storage file share, 
                              or a storage file directory.
                              The destination can also be a single file including:
                              a file system file, a blob or a storage file.
                              The destination is interpreted according to following rules:
                              1) When source is a single file, destination
                              is interpreted as a single file.
                              2) When source is a directory, destination 
                              is interpreted as a directory.

/SourceKey:<storage-key>      Specifies the storage account key for the
                              source resource.

/DestKey:<storage-key>        Specifies the storage account key for the
                              destination resource.

/SourceSAS:<SAS-Token>        Specifies a Shared Access Signature with READ
                              and LIST permissions for the source (if
                              applicable). Surround the SAS with double
                              quotes, as it may contains special command-line
                              characters.
                              The SAS must be a Container/Share SAS, or an
                              Account SAS with ResourceType that includes 
                              Container.
                              If the source resource is a blob container, 
                              and neither a key nor a SAS is provided, then 
                              the blob container will be read via anonymous 
                              access or OAuth.
                              If the source is a file share, a key or a SAS
                              must be provided.                            
                              
/DestSAS:<SAS-Token>          Specifies a Shared Access Signature (SAS) with
                              READ and WRITE permissions for the
                              destination (if applicable). When /Y is 
                              specified, and /XO /XN are not specified, the SAS
                              can have only WRITE permission for the operation
                              to succeed.
                              Surround the SAS with double quotes, as it may 
                              contains special command-line characters.
                              The SAS must be a Container/Share SAS, or an
                              Account SAS with ResourceType that includes 
                              Container.
                              If the destination resource is a blob container,
                              or file share, you can either specify this 
                              option followed by the SAS token, or you can 
                              specify the SAS as part of the destination blob 
                              container or file share's URI, without this 
                              option.                              
                              This option is not supported when asynchronously
                              copying between two different types of storage
                              service or between two different accounts.
                              
/V:[verbose-log-file]         Outputs verbose status messages into a log 
                              file.
                              By default, the verbose log file is named 
                              AzCopyVerbose.log in
                              %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy. If you 
                              specify an existing file location for this 
                              option, the verbose log will be appended to 
                              that file.

/Z:[journal-file-folder]      Specifies a journal file folder for resuming an 
                              operation.
                              AzCopy always supports resuming if an 
                              operation has been interrupted.
                              If this option is not specified, or it is 
                              specified without a folder path, then AzCopy 
                              will create the journal file in the default 
                              location, which is 
                              %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy.
                              Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it 
                              checks whether a journal file exists in the 
                              default folder, or whether it exists in a 
                              folder that you specified via this option. If 
                              the journal file does not exist in either 
                              place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and 
                              generates a new journal file.
                              If the journal file does exist, AzCopy will 
                              check whether the command line that you input 
                              matches the command line in the journal file. 
                              If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes 
                              the incomplete operation. If they do not match, 
                              you will be prompted to either overwrite the 
                              journal file to start a new operation, or to 
                              cancel the current operation.
                              The journal file is deleted upon successful 
                              completion of the operation.
                              Note that resuming an operation from a journal 
                              file created by a previous version of AzCopy 
                              is not supported.

/@:<parameter-file>           Specifies a file that contains parameters. 
                              AzCopy processes the parameters in the file 
                              just as if they had been specified on the 
                              command line.
                              In a response file, you can either specify 
                              multiple parameters on a single line, or 
                              specify each parameter on its own line. Note 
                              that an individual parameter cannot span 
                              multiple lines.
                              Response files can include comments lines that 
                              begin with the # symbol.
                              You can specify multiple response files. 
                              However, note that AzCopy does not support 
                              nested response files.

/Y                            Suppresses all AzCopy confirmation prompts.

/NC:<number-of-concurrent>    Specifies the number of concurrent operations.
                              AzCopy by default starts a certain number of 
                              concurrent operations to increase the data 
                              transfer throughput.
                              Note that large number of concurrent operations 
                              in a low-bandwidth environment may overwhelm 
                              the network connection and prevent the 
                              operations from fully completing. Throttle 
                              concurrent operations based on actual available 
                              network bandwidth.
                              The upper limit for concurrent operations is 
                              512.

##
## Options - Applicable for Blob and File Service Operations ##
##

/SourceType:<blob | file>    Specifies that the source resource is a blob 
                              or file available in the local development 
                              environment, running in the storage emulator.

/DestType:<blob | file>      Specifies that the destination resource is a 
                              blob or file available in the local 
                              development environment, running in the 
                              storage emulator.

/S                            Specifies recursive mode for copy operations.
                              The /S parameter is only valid when the
                              source is a directory.
                              In recursive mode, AzCopy will copy all blobs 
                              or files that match the specified file 
                              pattern, including those in subfolders.

/Pattern:<file-pattern>       Specifies a file pattern that indicates which 
                              files to copy.                                         
                              The behavior of the /Pattern parameter is 
                              determined by the location of the source data, 
                              and the presence of the recursive mode option.
                              The /Pattern parameter is only valid when the
                              source is a directory.
                              Recursive mode is specified via option /S.
                              
                              If the specified source is a directory in 
                              the file system, then standard wildcards are 
                              in effect, and the file pattern provided is 
                              matched against files within the directory. 
                              If option /S is specified, then AzCopy also 
                              matches the specified pattern against all 
                              files in any subfolders beneath the directory.
                              
                              If the specified source is a blob container or 
                              virtual directory, then wildcards are not 
                              applied. If option /S is specified, then AzCopy 
                              interprets the specified file pattern as a blob 
                              prefix. If option /S is not specified, then 
                              AzCopy matches the file pattern against exact 
                              blob names.
                              If the specified source is an Azure file share, 
                              then you must either specify the exact file 
                              name, (e.g. abc.txt) to copy a single file, or 
                              specify option /S to copy all files in the 
                              share recursively. Attempting to specify both a 
                              file pattern and option /S together will result 
                              in an error.
                              
                              AzCopy uses case-sensitive matching when the 
                              /Source is a blob, blob container or blob virtual 
                              directory, and uses case-insensitive matching 
                              in all the other cases.
                              
                              The default file pattern used when no file 
                              pattern is specified is *.* for a file system 
                              location or an empty prefix for an Azure 
                              Storage location. 
                              Specifying multiple file patterns is not 
                              supported.

/CheckMD5                     Calculates an MD5 hash for downloaded data and 
                              verifies that the MD5 hash stored in the blob 
                              or file's Content-MD5 property matches the 
                              calculated hash. The MD5 check is turned off by 
                              default, so you must specify this option to 
                              perform the MD5 check when downloading data.
                              Note that Azure Storage doesn't guarantee that 
                              the MD5 hash stored for the blob or file is 
                              up-to-date. It is client's responsibility to 
                              update the MD5 whenever the blob or file is 
                              modified.
                              AzCopy always sets the Content-MD5 property for 
                              an Azure blob or file after uploading it to the 
                              service.

/L                            Specifies a listing operation only; no data is 
                              copied.
                              AzCopy will interpret the using of this option as
                              a simulation for running the command line without
                              this option /L and count how many objects will
                              be copied, you can specify option /V at the same
                              time to check which objects will be copied in
                              the verbose log.
                              The behavior of this option is also determined by
                              the location of the source data and the presence
                              of the recursive mode option /S and file pattern
                              option /Pattern.
                              When using this option, AzCopy requires LIST and READ 
                              permission of the source location if source is a directory,
                              or READ permission of the source location if source
                              is a single file.
                              
/MT                           Sets the downloaded file's last-modified time 
                              to be the same as the source blob or file's.

/XN                           Excludes a newer source resource. The resource 
                              will not be copied if the source is the same  
                              or newer than destination.

/XO                           Excludes an older source resource. The resource 
                              will not be copied if the source resource is the
                              same or older than destination.

/A                            Uploads only files that have the Archive 
                              attribute set.

/IA:[RASHCNETOI]              Uploads only files that have any of the 
                              specified attributes set.
                              Available attributes include:

                              specified attributes set.
                              Available attributes include: 
                              R     Read-only files

/SyncCopy                     Indicates whether to synchronously copy blobs
                              or files among two Azure Storage end points.
                              AzCopy by default uses server-side 
                              asynchronous copy. Specify this option to 
                              download the blobs or files from the service 
                              to local memory and then upload them to the
                              service.
                              /SyncCopy can be used in below scenarios:
                              1) Copying from Blob storage to Blob storage.
                              2) Copying from File storage to File storage.
                              3) Copying from Blob storage to File storage.
                              4) Copying from File storage to Blob storage.

/SetContentType:[content-     
type]                         Specifies the content type of the destination 
                              blobs or files.
                              AzCopy by default uses 
                              "application/octet-stream" as the content type
                              for the destination blobs or files. If option
                              /SetContentType is specified without a value
                              for "content-type", then AzCopy will set each
                              blob or file's content type according to its
                              file extension. To set same content type for
                              all the blobs, you must explicitly specify a
                              value for "content-type".


##
## Options - Only applicable for Blob Service Operations ##
##


/BlobType:<page | block 
| append>                     Specifies whether the destination blob is a 
                              block blob, a page blob or an append blob.
                              If the destination is a blob and this option
                              is not specified, then by default AzCopy will
                              create a block blob.

/BlockSizeInMB:<block-size-in-mb>    Specifies the block size when 
                              destination is block blob. Must be multiple of 4MB, 
                              and must be >= 4MB, and <= 100MB.

/Delimiter:<delimiter>        Indicates the delimiter character used to 
                              delimit virtual directories in a blob name.
                              By default, AzCopy uses / as the delimiter 
                              character. However, AzCopy supports using any 
                              common character (such as @, #, or %) as a 
                              delimiter. If you need to include one of these 
                              special characters on the command line, enclose 
                              it with double quotes.
                              This option is only applicable for downloading 
                              from an Azure blob container or virtual directory.

/Snapshot                     Indicates whether to transfer snapshots. This 
                              option is only valid when the source is a 
                              blob container or blob virtual directory.
                              The transferred blob snapshots are renamed in 
                              this format: [blob-name] (snapshot-time)
                              [extension].
                              By default, snapshots are not copied.
